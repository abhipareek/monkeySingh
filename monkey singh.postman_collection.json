You build a close connection with your audience by whispering in their ears for an hour. But before your words reach the ears of your listeners, there is one area where visibility is most important: your podcast cover art.<br />Your podcast cover is the first thing your audience will see when they search for it on their phones. It is a first impression of your podcast and what you are trying to say. Most importantly, good podcast cover art is one of the requirements for a podcast embedded in iTunes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>How do can design the best podcast cover art?</strong></p> <p><br />Making podcast art sounds scary, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be! With the help of <a href=\\\"https://www.monkeysingh.com/\\\">graphic design companies in india</a>, some examples of inspiring podcast cover art, as well as a little art you can do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Let your product speak</strong></p> <p><br />If this is a podcast created as part of a product marketing effort, you already have the type to build on. But if it's your personal podcast, you can still work on tagging it. Either way, think of the big picture. How do you want your podcast to be seen by your audience? Do you have a product personality designed for your show? These are the details that set your show apart even if there are many similar shows in your niche.</p> <p><br />A podcast cover that reflects the personality of your product could be a creative variation of your logo or perhaps use a mascot that you use in your logo in a fun way. Remember to use the same images regularly in your ads and on social media channels. As did Headspace with its Radio Headspace podcast.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Get Your Great Podcast Art Right</strong></p> <p><br />Size DOES matter. Before you get into the nitty-gritty design of your logo, make sure you understand your podcast artwork you must follow certain basic requirements in terms of size to be accepted in all major podcast text lists.</p> <p><br />For all the major podcast references, Apple Podcasts has strong requirements, however, fortunately, many other platforms have similar needs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>See Competition</strong></p> <p><br />If you lack the inspiration for your podcast cover art, a great way to make your creative juices flow by looking at what your competitors and peers are doing.</p> <p><br />For example, if your podcast is focused on reading, why not try selecting the Apple Podcasts 'Education' section to see what is already on the list? Or click on the 'What's Hot' section of 'education' and think about why those particular podcasts stand out from the crowd.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Learn the language of the target audience</strong></p> <p><br />We are not speaking a human language here but a visual language. What you tell someone does not really matter if that person does not understand your language well? Similarly, the design of an amazing podcast cover will not work if you ignore the preferences of your audience. But how do you know if your target audience will like it? Public listening is the voice spoken here. Watch the conversations they have. Content they share.</p> <p><br />This is why experts continue to talk about the need for a good niche for your podcast. If you have a clear niche, it is easy to understand your target audience. And if you understand your intended audience, you know how they can pay attention to you. This also helps you understand the type of design that works best on your podcast cover.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Cut out the visible clutter</strong></p> <p><br />Because you have one image that will represent the entire episode you post, do not try to squeeze too many things into your podcast cover. Having a confusing cover is worse than having an unrelated stock image as part of the cover art of your podcast.</p> <p><br />Build on a simple concept and create a straightforward design. That is a way to win the hearts of your listeners. A small cover with a good message will also be a way to show your audience how you like to keep things organized. So they will know that your podcast will convey many important details in a short amount of time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Avoid overused podcasting images</strong></p> <p><br />Unless your podcast is about the podcast category, do not use microphone images and pop filters. Podcasting is the media you use &mdash; it is not the story of your show. Adding headphones to your artwork is like putting DVDs and cameras on a movie poster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Use the same marker</strong></p> <p><br />Apple, Coca-Cola, and Nike are all experts in branding because they use consistent images throughout their forums. Use the same colors, fonts, and images in your podcast artwork that you use on your website and social media.</p> <p>Your name and podcast cover art, work together harmoniously<br />The full podcast logo includes a host of things aimed at one goal: to tell the audience who you are, and why they should listen to you. It can be hard work, especially as many podcasts start out as love projects. They will be personal and close.</p> <p><br />But that does not mean that you should walk alone. Graphic design companies in india can take your style and tone, and create a podcast cover that conveys that feeling across all forums.</p>\",\n        \"date\": \"2022-08-30\",\n        \"image\": \"https://ik.imagekit.io/gzmznzzqlrz/blogpageImages/Untitled-design-4-Edited_wCwcOC4Sx.png?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1662019949252\",\n        \"metaDescription\": \"2022-08-30\"\n    }\n}"

Let me give you some tips here, when you are really serious about your business and its logo.</p>\\n<p>Company name in mind &#8211; When you start a new business, you should know the right name to decide. People recognize your company through your services. That is a fact we know. But people often see through our company name or logo too. So when writing keep your company name in mind and advise your logo designer to design something similar or featuring your company name. You can’t have the cross swords we see occasionally on the wall as your symbol to have your business logo. It&#8217;s just a good idea while you&#8217;re a king, planning to design a logo for your organization. So your company name and company logo must match.</p>\\n<p>Company services in mind &#8211; You know what you are offering. You know what you will add to your future contribution. You know what you are and what you were before. You also need to consider what you are and what you will become in the future. So keep your company&#8217;s resources in mind. What services do you provide and what services will you provide in the future. It says, if you have a small bakery today that sells biscuits and cookies. But in the future, you may find yourself famous for preparing &amp; selling wedding cakes in the area. So you need to have a logo that can be used and identify your business.</p>\\n<p>Company idea in mind &#8211; You should also keep your ideas in mind while <a href=\\\"https://www.monkeysingh.com/logo-design/\\\">creative logo design</a> for a hired logo designer. Vision is something we think about having our business in the future. It is a prediction that we should make our business reach a certain level or certain services. So this is important and really worth remembering.</p>\\n<p>Company marketing in mind &#8211; If you are already a product locally or nationally. You should see that your brand is affected by your logo. Your logo is a celebrity or personal identity. Therefore, you should also consider the name of your company, when writing.</p>\\n<p>In the minds of the company&#8217;s customers &#8211; If you are new to the business, you should not take any suggestion from any. But if you’re already famous, take one small update to one or two of your favorite customers. See if that allows them to share any items with your new logo design ideas. It could be a kind of small survey with your 10 &#8211; 15 customers. You will have a very good idea of ​​how you want it. You need to see what kind of customer base you have. You will need to get your customers&#8217; views on that too. Yes, but see what age customers are best at your business. You should only get advice from that customer level.\",\n            \"date\": \"2021-10-27\",\n            \"image\": \"https://ik.imagekit.io/gzmznzzqlrz/blogpageImages/GettyImages-1266126265-87747bb3a5af4d588e4e85711baec658_xuKYYpN_F.jpeg?updatedAt=1640101235295\",\n            \"metaDescription\": \"2021-10-27\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"title\": \"How to Design Attractive Club Flyer\",\n            \"description\": \"If you want to build a club flyer you can do this in two ways.

Many people think that building a club flyer is very difficult but in reality it is not. Every club flyer built is based on three elements. Vector, Image and Font style. The club flyer can have a photo or vector image or both. Whenever you create a flyer make sure the image shows something. This “something” will be your special event, the people who will be coming, the environment and more. The photo should reflect your special event in a very attractive way. After all a club flyer is an ad</p>\\n<p>Otherwise your club or special event should not be confused. Those who want to come should come easily and make sure tickets are readily available. Here are some steps you can use to design creative club flyers. First of all you may need photo editing software. The best on the market is Adobe software. It will cost you but it will give you a big profit over time. You will not regret your decision. You can also get free photo software’s, but they won&#8217;t give you enough customization capabilities. To print a club flyer you will also need a paper printer. Generally printer of flyers prints 4 by 6, 8.5 to 2.75 and in various formats. Whatever image you have, you can open it in the photo editing software. You can also create your own photo with the help of photo editing software.</p>\\n<p>You can make the images in a dynamic area or in the name of Microsoft but designing them there will be very difficult. You should remember that these are not photo editing software. You can create a flyer in two ways. It can be one-sided or it can be double-sided. Creating a two-dimensional flyer is great, as it can be very attractive in appearance. The back of the club flyer should always be a solid color. You can use any color depending on the theme but make sure it is solid. The font you can use should always be visible in a solid background. If the background is dark you can use bright font colors and more. Add information about event, date, time, location and more. You can place the text in front of the top or bottom. You can also place this information on the back of the flyer. The back side usually has more filling space.</p>\\n<p>If you found it difficult to design a creative flyer then you may <a href=\\\"https://www.monkeysingh.com/banner-design/\\\">hire affordable graphic designer</a> to design your club flyers.\",\n            \"date\": \"2021-10-27\",\n            \"image\": \"https://ik.imagekit.io/gzmznzzqlrz/blogpageImages/33a7a1d8e1e4c99adf936f3726ac7e27_z2CbjIKaIsS.jpeg?updatedAt=1640101329160\",\n            \"metaDescription\": \"2021-10-27\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"

You build a close connection with your audience by whispering in their ears for an hour. But before your words reach the ears of your listeners, there is one area where visibility is most important: your podcast cover art.<br />Your podcast cover is the first thing your audience will see when they search for it on their phones. It is a first impression of your podcast and what you are trying to say. Most importantly, good podcast cover art is one of the requirements for a podcast embedded in iTunes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>How do can design the best podcast cover art?</strong></p> <p><br />Making podcast art sounds scary, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be! With the help of <a href=\\\"https://www.monkeysingh.com/\\\">graphic design companies in india</a>, some examples of inspiring podcast cover art, as well as a little art you can do.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Let your product speak</strong></p> <p><br />If this is a podcast created as part of a product marketing effort, you already have the type to build on. But if it's your personal podcast, you can still work on tagging it. Either way, think of the big picture. How do you want your podcast to be seen by your audience? Do you have a product personality designed for your show? These are the details that set your show apart even if there are many similar shows in your niche.</p> <p><br />A podcast cover that reflects the personality of your product could be a creative variation of your logo or perhaps use a mascot that you use in your logo in a fun way. Remember to use the same images regularly in your ads and on social media channels. As did Headspace with its Radio Headspace podcast.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Get Your Great Podcast Art Right</strong></p> <p><br />Size DOES matter. Before you get into the nitty-gritty design of your logo, make sure you understand your podcast artwork you must follow certain basic requirements in terms of size to be accepted in all major podcast text lists.</p> <p><br />For all the major podcast references, Apple Podcasts has strong requirements, however, fortunately, many other platforms have similar needs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>See Competition</strong></p> <p><br />If you lack the inspiration for your podcast cover art, a great way to make your creative juices flow by looking at what your competitors and peers are doing.</p> <p><br />For example, if your podcast is focused on reading, why not try selecting the Apple Podcasts 'Education' section to see what is already on the list? Or click on the 'What's Hot' section of 'education' and think about why those particular podcasts stand out from the crowd.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Learn the language of the target audience</strong></p> <p><br />We are not speaking a human language here but a visual language. What you tell someone does not really matter if that person does not understand your language well? Similarly, the design of an amazing podcast cover will not work if you ignore the preferences of your audience. But how do you know if your target audience will like it? Public listening is the voice spoken here. Watch the conversations they have. Content they share.</p> <p><br />This is why experts continue to talk about the need for a good niche for your podcast. If you have a clear niche, it is easy to understand your target audience. And if you understand your intended audience, you know how they can pay attention to you. This also helps you understand the type of design that works best on your podcast cover.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Cut out the visible clutter</strong></p> <p><br />Because you have one image that will represent the entire episode you post, do not try to squeeze too many things into your podcast cover. Having a confusing cover is worse than having an unrelated stock image as part of the cover art of your podcast.</p> <p><br />Build on a simple concept and create a straightforward design. That is a way to win the hearts of your listeners. A small cover with a good message will also be a way to show your audience how you like to keep things organized. So they will know that your podcast will convey many important details in a short amount of time.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Avoid overused podcasting images</strong></p> <p><br />Unless your podcast is about the podcast category, do not use microphone images and pop filters. Podcasting is the media you use &mdash; it is not the story of your show. Adding headphones to your artwork is like putting DVDs and cameras on a movie poster.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Use the same marker</strong></p> <p><br />Apple, Coca-Cola, and Nike are all experts in branding because they use consistent images throughout their forums. Use the same colors, fonts, and images in your podcast artwork that you use on your website and social media.</p> <p>Your name and podcast cover art, work together harmoniously<br />The full podcast logo includes a host of things aimed at one goal: to tell the audience who you are, and why they should listen to you. It can be hard work, especially as many podcasts start out as love projects. They will be personal and close.</p> <p><br />But that does not mean that you should walk alone. Graphic design companies in india can take your style and tone, and create a podcast cover that conveys that feeling across all forums.</p>\",\n        \"date\": \"2022-08-30\",\n        \"image\": \"https://ik.imagekit.io/gzmznzzqlrz/blogpageImages/Untitled-design-4-Edited_wCwcOC4Sx.png?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1662019949252\",\n        \"metaDescription\": \"2022-08-30\"\n    }\n}"
